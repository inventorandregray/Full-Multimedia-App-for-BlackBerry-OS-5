________________________________________
Notes on OS 5 Compatibility
●	Video must be small (<100 KB for smooth playback).

●	Audio files should be short (<2–3 MB) to prevent memory issues.

●	No background multitasking for media; all playback happens in the same thread.

●	Touch support is minimal on OS 5 devices; buttons mainly work with trackball/keyboard.
